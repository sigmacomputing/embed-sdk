# embed-sdk

Experimental SDK for Sigma Embeds. They are a wrapper over postmessage APIs.

TODO:

- [ ] Create an example app in the Examples directory. This should be a comprehensive example of how to use the SDK.
- [ ] Make the react hooks for all the APIs.
- [ ] Add the JSDoc comments for all the APIs. We want to follow the format that I have in the react-sdk.
- [ ] Setup a real publish flow and CI.
- [ ] Automate the generation of SDKs instead of the manual work we do now. 

For example usage look at [embed-dogfooding](https://github.com/sigmacomputing/embed-dogfooding/blob/main/components/sigma-embed.tsx)
